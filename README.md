# ProjectPONG
Project Pong Demo
Original Pong doesn't capture the fast-paced excitement you may experience in ping pong. Now imagine they kick up the speed, ramp up the lights, and crank up epic tunes.

That is not what this game is... As of right now. Through updates and improvements to my own skills I'll try to make this game a better representation of the dream I hold to mind. 

A Semi-Unique Spin on the Original Pong

Test your speed, reaction, and will in a fast-paced game of table tennis. Dash to make powerful attacks and quick saves, or burst to curve the ball in your favor. 

THIS IS A MULTIPLAYER-ONLY GAME AS OF RIGHT NOW

If you don't have friends/siblings to play with locally I recommend using PARSEC to play with friends online.
The game is in very early progress and only serves to show the base of the game.
I hope to add many things to it still and if you are interested in what the game will evolve into you can follow progress semi regularly via
